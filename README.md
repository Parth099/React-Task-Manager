# React Task Manager
This project was made as a tool to learn the basics of the React Library. Task Manager was an idea from the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/handle-inputs-and-render-lists) to get new learners confortable with React `props` & `state`.
